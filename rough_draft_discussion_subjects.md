#Hardware platform support


* When 15:45 - 17:45
* Room: Medicom Village Auditorium, ESS
* Subject : Discussion about support of different hardware platforms (RPi, MTCA, design sharing, open source solutions,FPGA...) in EPICS

My first question to myself is *What is hardware?*, then I searched them in EPICS site, and found the page which has the name of *Hardware Support: by Bus, by Manufacturer, by Contact Name, or By Link* at http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/bus.php

And I sent an email to Teck-talk at http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/tech-talk/2016/msg00908.php, but no one actually reply yet! Anyway, better than nothing, so I did small preparations for this meeting. I think, most of HW can talk by using ASYN already. 

## RPi or others?

Tech-talk Search Results : Found 124 pages for "raspberry pi" (most recent first)

* GPIO   : https://github.com/ffeldbauer/epics-devgpio
* I2C    : https://github.com/ffeldbauer/drvAsynI2C
* Serial : https://github.com/jeonghanlee/gconpi

## Crate or Chasis, or Power Distribution Units, or pizza-box Management
  * monitor/change a status of HW though EPICS
  * update/revert the corresponding firmware through EPICS

###  SNMP (FRIB), we can use it for Wiener Products (e.g., Wiener VME Crate), and APC Power Distribution Unit

* https://groups.nscl.msu.edu/controls/ FRIB internal, Download source file
* https://github.com/EuropeanSpallationSource/snmp-nscl A forked the latest FRIB sources by ESS

Note that the Wiener is developing SNMPV3 support currently. We can use this for the most SNMP supported Network devices (Printers, Network Switches, Power Distribution Unit, Servers, and so on)

### IPMI (SLAC), we can use it for IPMI-based systems (e.g., xTCA systems)

* SLAC internal
